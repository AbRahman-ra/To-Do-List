## Description :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

- I made a dummy website to simulate a to-do list website. When a user adds a task, it will be saved for next time if the website is closed or reloaded
- The tasks will be ordered descendingly (recently added tasks first)
- The user can delete the undesired / finished tasks

---

## Code Structure :computer:

1. Initialization
2. Reloading Page
   1. Bringing existing tasks in local storage
   2. Store tasks in an array
   3. Save tasks in local storage
3. Insert a Task on "Add" Button Click
4. Make "Enter" Button Adds a Task
5. [FUNCTION] Print All Existing Tasks On Page Load
6. [FUNCTION] Input a Task
7. [FUNCTION] Print the last (added) task on the document
8. [FUNCTION] Delete the recorded tasks

---

## Limitations :exclamation:

- Responsiveness (I am not concerned with CSS as much as the functionality)
  - I might update it later
- When entering duplicate tasks, and deleting one of them, it will delete only the last duplicate task in the list.
  - This is not very user harmful, the only disadvantage for this is that the order might be messed
